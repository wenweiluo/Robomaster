### Introduction
To verify the control performances of the developed approximate RL-based control policy, trajectory tracking experiments are implemented by a car-like vehicle named as QCar (Quanser self-driving car). The results show that the proposed control scheme possesses well optimization and trajectory tracking performance under input constraints.
